Color themes based on various pride flags, made in my personal style. If there is a specific flag that you would like to see a theme of, feel free to shoot me an email or open an issue on GitHub and I'd love to take a crack at it!\

## Installation

### Automatic

### Manual

If you really want to install this extention manually, you can clone the files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/The-Gamer69/elizas-pride-themes). After that, copy it into `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder on Linux (or `<install path>\Microsoft VS Code\resources\app\extensions` on Windows) and restart VSCode.

### **Enjoy!**
