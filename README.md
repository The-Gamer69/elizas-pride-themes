Color themes based on various pride flags that reperesent me, made in my personal style. There's only the trans flag now, but I'll probably add more in the future.\

## Installation

### Automatic

Go to the [VSCode Marketplace]() and click the install button on the top of the site. You should be prompted to open VSCode in order to install the extension.

### Manual

If you really want to install this extention manually, you can clone the files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/The-Gamer69/elizas-pride-themes). After that, copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart VSCode.

### **Enjoy!**
